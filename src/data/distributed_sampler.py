class DistributedEvalSampler(Sampler):
    r"""
    DistributedEvalSampler is different from DistributedSampler.
    It does NOT add extra samples to make it evenly divisible.
    DistributedEvalSampler should NOT be used for training. The distributed processes could hang forever.
    See this issue for details: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/22584
    shuffle is disabled by default

    DistributedEvalSampler is for evaluation purpose where synchronization does not happen every epoch.
    Synchronization should be done outside the dataloader loop.

    Sampler that restricts data loading to a subset of the dataset.

    It is especially useful in conjunction with
    :class:`torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`. In such a case, each
    process can pass a :class`~torch.utils.data.DistributedSampler` instance as a
    :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader` sampler, and load a subset of the
    original dataset that is exclusive to it.

    .. note::
        Dataset is assumed to be of constant size.

    Arguments:
        dataset: Dataset used for sampling.
        num_replicas (int, optional): Number of processes participating in
            distributed training. By default, :attr:`rank` is retrieved from the
            current distributed group.
        rank (int, optional): Rank of the current process within :attr:`num_replicas`.
            By default, :attr:`rank` is retrieved from the current distributed
            group.
        shuffle (bool, optional): If ``True`` (default), sampler will shuffle the
            indices.
        seed (int, optional): random seed used to shuffle the sampler if
            :attr:`shuffle=True`. This number should be identical across all
            processes in the distributed group. Default: ``0``.

    .. warning::
        In distributed mode, calling the :meth`set_epoch(epoch) <set_epoch>` method at
        the beginning of each epoch **before** creating the :class:`DataLoader` iterator
        is necessary to make shuffling work properly across multiple epochs. Otherwise,
        the same ordering will be always used.
